When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using a remote repository allows us to access the repository on different terminals. In addition it allows for collaborations with other individuals who can update and commit files to the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling manually might overwrite the current changes that you have on your local repository that you have not committed yet. In addition you may recieve code from another collaborator that you don't want on your machine because it would cause a bug.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used to clone a repository from github onto githubs local server. Clones allow us to create a second copy of a repository from ANY server to ANY server. Branches allow us to create a seconary round of edits within the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows for edits to the files without fear of having merge collisions.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without Git or GitHub, we would be emailing code back and forth between our group. It would be easy to maintain communication between the group and handle conflicts. However, retrieving the older versions would be much harder. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
